# Sound It Out
Final Project for CMSC320 Fall 2019

Reading words and being able to pronounce them is a complex process involving the coordination of multiple skills and linguistic systems in order to result in fluent behaviors. It is important for researchers to investigate the skills and systems involved in reading and speaking in order to be able to design educational programs and learning environments that foster growth in these skills and systems. Reading and speaking involves the coordination of multiple systems including orthography and phonology.

Sound it out uses data from a website containing the “top 1000 words” in English featuring the written and phonetic spelling of each word, to create a model that takes in the spelling of a word and output a prediction at its pronunciation.
